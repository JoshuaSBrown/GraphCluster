# Unassuming Graph LibrarY (UGLY)

Is a small library for implemented some graph functionality. 

# GraphCluster
This template is used to make use of the GraphNode template. In terms of graph theory together the graph cluster can be used to compare two networks and determine if they are the same or not. This will thus very easily extend to molecules. In these cases the atoms act as vertices and the bonds create the network.
